## Build Guide
### Windows
- make sure you have a C++17 compiler (recommended vs2017)
- make sure you have CMake 3.9+ (recommended 3.14)
- make sure you have Qt5 (recommended 5.12)
- at this point you may have 3 options
	1. configure cmake (`cmake . -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" -B build`) then open the solution
	2. open the cmake file using Visual Studio Directly
	3. open the cmake file using QtCreator which will give you all the Qt Goodies right out of the box
